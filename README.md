# About
The Magic Carpet can be obtained in Survival mode by collecting White Wool, which will unlock the recipe.
The Magic Carpet requires 4 Yellow Wool, 2 Red Wool, 2 Diamond Blocks and 1 Nether Star to craft.
Once in the vehicle, players can move horizontally using WASD.
To move up, hold space while looking straight ahead or slightly up.
To move down, look almost completely down.

# Known Bugs
- All Magic Carpets without passengers will rotate on their own to face the same direction as the Magic Carpet that has most recently received a new first passenger.
- Second passenger is attached to same position as first passenger (reducing visibility in first person)
