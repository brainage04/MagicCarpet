# About
The Magic Carpet can be obtained in Survival mode by collecting Wool, which will unlock the recipe.

The Magic Carpet requires 4 Yellow Wool, 2 Red Wool, 2 Diamond Blocks and 1 Nether Star to craft.

Once in the vehicle, players can move horizontally using WASD.
To move up, hold space while looking straight ahead or slightly up.
To move down, look almost completely down.

# Known Bugs
- Velocity is paused when controlling passenger exits vehicle, then resumes when they re-enter
- (is this a bug? might be annoying if you're going fast and then exit the Magic Carpet, and it moves out from underneath you while you're really high up, and then you die of fall damage)
