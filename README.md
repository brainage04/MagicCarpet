# About
The first Magic Carpet recipe (Basic Magic Carpet) can be unlocked by collecting Wool of any colour.
Crafting said Magic Carpet will unlock the recipe for the next tier of Magic Carpet.

There are three different tiers of Magic Carpet:
1. Basic - 4 Yellow Wool, 2 Red Wool, 2 String, 1 Stick
2. Advanced - 1 Basic Magic Carpet, 4 Blaze Powder, 4 Gold Blocks
3. Legendary - 1 Advanced Magic Carpet, 1 Nether Star, 2 Ender Pearls, 2 Diamond Blocks, 3 Emerald Blocks

Each Magic Carpet tier has the following stats (time from stationary to max speed):
1. Basic - 0 to 10m/s in 2 seconds
2. Advanced - 0 to 20m/s in 1 second
3. Legendary - 0 to 40m/s in 0.5 seconds

Once in the vehicle, players can move horizontally using WASD.
To move up, hold space while looking straight ahead or slightly up.
To move down, look almost completely down.
